## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> I want to build a built-out wire frame of a website that labels each section of the site and connects to the content model as well. That way I can go into the editor and simply tell the ai what section of the site to change. Can this be built?

### Code Generation Prompt

> Built a simple wireframe of a website that can show where each section of the website is. This way I can make individual changes to specific parts of the website by calling out that section.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

## üì° Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching Page Structure
```typescript
// Get a page with all its sections and content blocks
const response = await cosmic.objects.findOne({
  type: 'site-pages',
  slug: 'homepage'
}).depth(2); // Deep fetch to include content blocks

const page = response.object as SitePage;
```

### Getting Section Details
```typescript
// Fetch sections with their content blocks
const sections = await cosmic.objects.find({
  type: 'page-sections',
  'metadata.is_active': true
}).depth(1);
```

### Content Block Management
```typescript
// Update a specific content block
await cosmic.objects.updateOne(contentBlockId, {
  metadata: {
    headline: 'Updated Hero Title',
    subheading: 'New subheading text'
  }
});
```

## üéØ Cosmic CMS Integration

This application integrates with your Cosmic bucket using four content types:

- **Site Pages**: Define page structure and URL routing
- **Page Sections**: Organize content into labeled wireframe sections
- **Content Blocks**: Store actual content, media, and settings
- **Page Templates**: Provide reusable layout structures

The wireframe system uses section IDs (hero, features, testimonials) and wireframe references (WF-001-HERO) to create a clear mapping between your content model and the visual website structure.
